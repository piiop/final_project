# Art Style Classifier and Analysis System

![Project Banner](readme_banner.png)

## 🎨 Overview
For our final Bootcamp project, I chose to train a CNN to classify a piece of artwork by it's style, selecting
from popular art styles and movements. This classifying model is paired with a language model to answer user questions
and respond with key information about the artistic style. Finally, combining these two models with augmented 
reality capabilities for real-time overlays. By doing this project, I hope to use the knowledge and tools I've learned during
this Bootcamp, as well as additional skills and technologies, to build a complete project that could be deployed in
a real world scenario.
