      "      \"biography\": \"Flemish painter and draughtsman. He was the son of the eminent Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Brueghel the Elder. A close friend and frequent collaborator with Peter Paul Rubens, the two artists were the leading Flemish painters in the first three decades of the 17th century.\\nBrueghel worked in many genres including history paintings, flower still lifes, allegorical and mythological scenes, landscapes and seascapes, hunting pieces, village scenes, battle scenes and scenes of hellfire and the underworld. He was an important innovator who invented new types of paintings such as flower garland paintings, paradise landscapes, and gallery paintings in the first quarter of the 17th century.\\nHe further created genre paintings that were imitations, pastiches and reworkings of his father's works, in particular his father's genre scenes and landscapes with peasants. Brueghel represented the type of the pictor doctus, the erudite painter whose works are informed by the religious motifs and aspirations of the Catholic Counter-Reformation as well as the scientific revolution with its interest in accurate description and classification. He was court painter of the Archduke and Duchess Albrecht and Isabella, the governors of the Southern Netherlands.\\nThe artist was nicknamed \\\"Velvet\\\" Brueghel, \\\"Flower\\\" Brueghel, and \\\"Paradise\\\" Brueghel. The first is believed to have been given him because of his mastery in the rendering of fabrics. The second nickname is a reference to his specialization in flower still lifes and the last one to his invention of the genre of the paradise landscape. His brother Pieter Brueghel the Younger was traditionally nicknamed \\\"de helse Brueghel\\\" or \\\"Hell Brueghel\\\" because it was believed he was the author of a number of paintings with fantastic depictions of fire and grotesque imagery. These paintings have now been reattributed to Jan Brueghel the Elder.\",\n",

      "      \"biography\": \"Caravaggio was a master Italian painter, father of the Baroque style, who led a tumultuous life that was cut short his by his fighting and brawling. As a child and art student, he trained in Milan under a teacher who had been taught by the great Italian painter Titian himself, and who exposed him to the great works of Leonardo de Vinci and the Lombard artists. He moved to Rome in 1592, after certain quarrels resulted in the wounding of a police officer. Rome at the time was in a period if great expansion, and the many churches and palaces being built were all in need of paintings to decorate the walls. Caravaggio also moved to Rome during the Counter-Reformation, in which the Roman Catholic Church tried to stem the rising tide of Protestantism, and was commissioning many works to elevate the social status of the Church. \\n\\nHe arrived in Rome starving and destitute, and immediately began working for Giuseppe Cesari, the favorite painter of the Pope, and throughout the end of the 16th century his reputation as a great painter grew. His big break came in 1599, when he was commissioned to paint the Contarelli Chapel in Rome, which was finished in 1600. after which he began receiving many commissions, both public and private. Some of his works, being controversial in subject matter (his unacceptably vulgar realistic style) and models (one of his favorite models for the Virgin Mary was a prostitute), and some of his works were returned to be painted over or fixed. Others were returned entirely, but Caravaggio always had a public willing to snatch up any painting he produced. \\n\\nAs a street brawler, his police records and court proceedings fill many pages. In 1606, he killed a young man in a street fight and fled to Naples, where he was protected by the Colonna family. In 1608, he was arrested and put in jail for another brawl in Naples, but he managed to escape. In his flight from the law, he traveled through Milan, Syracuse, Sicily, Palermo, Malta, and Messina, continually receiving commissions. He returned to Naples to live with the Colonna family and seek a pardon from the Pope, and in 1606, an assassination attempt was made of his life, leaving his face permanently disfigured. \\n\\n In the summer of 1610, he took a boat from Naples to Rome, along with three paintings as an offering of peace, seeking a pardon from the Pope. He never arrived at his destination, having mysteriously died along the way. Although his artistic technique fathered the Baroque style, he was quickly forgotten after his death. It was not until the 1920\\u2019s that his body of work began to be fully received and appreciated.\",\n",

      "      \"biography\": \"A Flemish painter, Peter Paul Rubens\\u2019 Baroque style emphasized movement, sensuality and color. Although he was raised as a Catholic and painted Counter-Reformation pieces f or the church, he was born into a Protestant family. In 1568, his mother and father fled the Spanish Netherlands due to persecution of Protestants. Jan Rubens, Peter Paul\\u2019s father, began a sordid affair with the woman to whom he was court advisor, Anna of Saxony. His father was imprisoned for the affair and two years after his death, Peter and his family returned to Antwerp, in the Netherlands, and beginning at the age of twelve was raised as a Catholic. He began his artistic apprenticeship at age fourteen and completed his education in 1598, when he became an independent master painter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his career, Rubens traveled to Italy and Spain, and was influenced by the great works of Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto, as well as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo. He returned to Antwerp upon his mother\\u2019s death in 1608, and remained there as a court painter for the Archduke of Austria, and received special privileges as both a painter and a court diplomat. In 1610, Rubens moved into the house that would become his studio, where he taught students and created most of his paintings. This house has now become the Rubenshius Museum. His most famous students, friends and collaborators were Frans Snyders, Anthony van Dyck, and Jan Brueghel the Elder. \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout his life, he was relied upon not only as a master painter, but one whose diplomat talents were required by many a court. Between 1627 and 1630, he traveled between England and Spain, in attempts to create a truce between the two nations. He was knighted by both the Spanish monarch, Philip V, and the English King, Charles I. Cambridge University also awarded him an honorary Master\\u2019s Degree. \\r\\n\\r\\nFour years after the death of his first wife, Rubens, who was 53 years old at the time, was married to a 16 year old named Helene Fourment, whom he used as model in many of his later paintings. His fondness for the full figured woman has since spurned the term \\u201cRubenesque,\\u201d which is still used in Dutch to refer to such women.  \",\n",

      "      \"biography\": \"Frans Hals is one of the most celebrated and prominent painters of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/dutch-golden-age]Dutch Golden Age[/url], probably only second to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url] or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer]Vermeer[/url]. Although Hals enjoyed success during his lifetime, he was largely forgotten by the generations that followed. Only in the 19th century, his art was appreciated again, mainly due to the work of French journalist and art critic, Theophile Thor\\u00e9-B\\u00fcrger. One of the essential characteristics of Hals's art is a sketchy aesthetic exhibited in loose and unblended brushstrokes. B\\u00fcrger recognized the virtuosity of Hals's expressive style and praised the spontaneity, vitality, and freedom of his art. In his writings, B\\u00fcrger did not only renew the interest in Hals's work, but he also connected Hals's art to the artwork produced by the contemporaries of the time. In this way, Hals became particularly appealing to the modern sensibilities of 19th-century artists, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Claude Monet[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustave Courbet[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Edouard Manet[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/james-mcneill-whistler]James Abbott McNeill Whistler[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent van Gogh[/url].\\n\\nHals was born in 1582 or 1583 in Antwerp. Soon after, his family fled to the north to escape Spanish domination. They settled in Haarlem, where Hals will reside for the rest of his life. In 1610, Hals joined the Haarlem [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/guild-of-saint-luke]Guild of Saint Luke[/url], and around the same time, he married his first wife, Anneke Harmensdochter. However, Anneke died in 1615, and two years later, Hals married his second wife, Lysbeth Reyniers. In 1616 Hals received his first significant commission and created the first group portrait of his career, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/banquet-of-the-officers-of-the-st-george-civic-guard-company-1616][i]Banquet of the St. George Civic Guard[/i][/url] (1616). Here, Hals successfully captures the individual characteristics of the twelve sitters in the lively, joyful atmosphere of the banquet. In the same year, the artist also traveled to Antwerp, where he spent approximately four months. The trip was significant because it acquainted Hals with works of Flemish artists like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens]Peter Paul Rubens[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-jordaens]Jacob Jordaens[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Anthony van Dyck[/url].\\n\\nIn earlier stages, Hals worked simultaneously in two stylistic modes. For commissioned portraits, his style was smooth and refined, while generic subjects he painted in a more loose and expressive style. The last one we can distinguish while comparing commissioned portraits, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/the-laughing-cavalier-1624][i]The Laughing Cavalier[/i][/url] (1624) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-jacob-pietersz-olycan][i]Portrait of Jacob Pietersz Olycan[/i][/url] (1625) to genre portraits from the same period, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-a-jester-with-a-lute][i]Portrait of a Jester with Lute[/i][/url] (ca.1623-1624) and  [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/boy-with-a-lute][i]Boy with a Lute[/i][/url] (ca. 1625). In the 1630s, Hals turned his attention solely to commissioned portraiture, and at the same time, he gradually transitioned to his rougher style of painting. In later works, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-willem-coymans-1645][i]Portrait of Willem Coymans[/i][/url] (1645) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-jasper-schade-van-westrum-1645][i]Portrait of Jasper Schade van Westrum[/i][/url] (1645), the traces of the artist's brush become more evident. Massive dabs of white mold collars and sleeve ruffles, and opulent embroideries that were executed meticulously in the 1620s, are marked now by short sketchy strokes. Hals continuously painted into old age. The group paintings which form a pendant, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/regents-of-the-old-men-s-alms-house-haarlem-1664][i]Regents of the Old Men's Alms House, Haarlem[/i][/url] (1664), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/the-regentesses-of-the-old-men-s-almhouse-haarlem-1664][i]The Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse, Haarlem[/i][/url] (1664) were painted only two years before his death. Frans Hals died in 1666 and was buried at St. Bavo's Church in Haarlem.\",\n",
